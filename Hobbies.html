		<h1>BASKET BALL </h1>
		<p>Basketball is a popular team sport played between two teams of five players each. 
		The objective is to score points by shooting a ball through a hoop mounted 10 feet above the floor.
		Players move the ball by dribbling (bouncing it while walking or running) or passing it to teammates. 
		The team with the most points at the end of the game wins.
		Basketball is known for its fast pace, athleticism, and strategic elements. 
		It involves various skills such as shooting, dribbling, passing, rebounding, and defending. 
		The game is played on a rectangular court with markings for boundaries, 
		including a center circle and three-point lines.
		Basketball was invented by Dr. James Naismith in December 1891 in Springfield, Massachusetts, 
		United States. Since then, it has grown into one of the most popular and widely played sports worldwide,
		with professional leagues such as the NBA (National Basketball Association) in the United States and international
		competitions like the FIBA Basketball World Cup and the Olympic Games.</p>
